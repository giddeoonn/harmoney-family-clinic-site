🩺 Harmoney Family Clinic — Clinic Website (Sample Project)

This is a fictional clinic website I designed as part of my web development practice. 
It’s a static, fully responsive one-page site made to represent a family-focused health clinic, with a clean, approachable design that highlights trust, care, and accessibility.

🧠 About the Project

This project was built to simulate the needs of a small medical clinic or private practice — simple navigation, clear service presentation, and a welcoming aesthetic. It gave me the opportunity to focus on professional layout structure, readability, and user-friendly design in the context of a healthcare website.
